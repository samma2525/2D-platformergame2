So This is a simple platformer game I made while trying to learn unity. it have the simplest functions of platformers games like patroling enemy, coins collections, moving ground and health bar.
As I am learning I used some AI to understand the errors and code not to write parts of code, sometimes I just can't see the error so I tell him to notice it and tell me how to fix it and try to fix it myself as I am really passionate about learning the code structure itself.
I would love to have any feekbacks on the game!
